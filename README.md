# rpgprototype
My rpg prototype! It's mine!
I'm making this in gamemaker 2. The goal is to create the functionality of a simple turn based RPG ala early Final Fantasy. It'll feature eight characters of my own design, very much a WIP right now. In fact, I'm not even intending to share it outside of my circle of friends - what are you doing here? Shoo!

I GUESS if you contact me and ask for it I'll consider allowing you to look at the code. It's not anything revolutionary!
